README: YourCarbon App

Overview

YourCarbon is an open-source SwiftUI project designed to track and calculate usersâ€™ carbon footprint across multiple categories such as Fuel Usage, Electricity Usage, LPG Usage, and Plastic Waste. The app aims to help users monitor and reduce their carbon emissions. This project is public and can be used by anyone for learning purposes.

Features

	1.	Fuel Usage Calculator: Calculates COâ‚‚ emissions based on vehicle type, fuel type, fuel consumption, and vehicle range.
	2.	Electricity Usage Calculator: Calculates COâ‚‚ emissions based on the amount of electricity used.
	3.	Plastic Waste Calculator: Allows users to track COâ‚‚ emissions generated by plastic waste.
	4.	LPG Usage Calculator: Allows users to monitor and record COâ‚‚ emissions from LPG usage.
	5.	Statistics View: Displays daily, weekly, and category-specific statistics for COâ‚‚ emissions.
	6.	Dark Mode & Light Mode Support: The app supports both dark and light themes.
	7.	User Target Setting: Users can set daily COâ‚‚ reduction targets.
	8.	Education Section: Provides educational content on how to reduce carbon emissions in different categories (Fuel, Electricity, LPG, and Plastic Waste).

Installation Instructions

1.	Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/YourCarbon.git

2.	Open in Xcode:
  â€¢	Open the .xcodeproj file in Xcode.
3.	Build and Run:
	â€¢	Select the desired simulator or your device.
	â€¢	Press Cmd + R to build and run the application.

Usage

The app is intuitive and can be used to track your daily COâ‚‚ emissions in the following categories:

	â€¢	Fuel: Enter your vehicle type, fuel type, fuel consumption, and range to calculate emissions.
	â€¢	Electricity: Input your usage time and electricity consumption to track emissions.
	â€¢	Plastic Waste: Track plastic waste emissions by entering the type of plastic and its weight.
	â€¢	LPG: Input LPG usage information to track associated COâ‚‚ emissions.

User Interface:

	â€¢	The main screen provides navigation to different calculators.
	â€¢	The statistics view provides daily, weekly, and total COâ‚‚ emissions based on user input.
	â€¢	Users can toggle between light and dark modes automatically based on system settings.

Code Overview

	â€¢	HomeView.swift: Main interface for navigation between different emission calculators.
	â€¢	FuelUsageView.swift: Interface for inputting fuel data and calculating COâ‚‚ emissions.
	â€¢	ElectricityUsageView.swift: Interface for inputting electricity usage and calculating COâ‚‚ emissions.
	â€¢	PlasticWasteView.swift: Interface for inputting plastic waste and calculating COâ‚‚ emissions.
	â€¢	StatisticsView.swift: Displays detailed statistics, including emissions by category and a graph for visualizing data.
	â€¢	CoreDataManager.swift: Handles Core Data interactions, such as saving, fetching, and updating records.
	â€¢	ViewModel.swift: Handles logic for fetching data, performing calculations, and managing states between views.
